title: TenWords Journal
---

**TL;DR: I created an MVP, text-only version of [1 Second Everyday](https://1se.co/)**

----------

**Here's how I ended up here:**
1. Make habit building software
2. I've failed to make journaling a habit
3. Make a habit building journaling app
4. Okay, I'm making TenWords Journal
5. Write at least ten words a day
6. If I miss a day then all my previous entries get deleted
7. Wait, that didn't work out so well
8. Try to write ten words each and every day
9. I feel most of my days aren't journal worthy
10. Now this app inadvertently highlights the general mundaneness of my life

**It's funny because I don't feel that my life is boring at all.**
1. I like software engineering
2. I have hobbies that still offer much to learn
3. I made $0.29 off of TenWords Journal

**Takeaways**
1. Don't invest too much time in brand upfront
2. Identify potential competitors from every angle. Tunnel vision caused me to overlook 1 Second Everyday
3. UX can make or break software. It is worth investing time in wireframes and UX flows.
4. Keep costs as close to $0.00 as possible. 
	- I saved money using Coredata and Cloudkit instead of Firebase
	- I wasted time prototyping with Firebase
	- I wasted time and money in prematurely creating [TenWordsJournal.com](http://www.tenwordsjournal.com/)
	- I wasted time having UX and UI crises


Instead of creating an app that would take short entries to write a life story, I ended up highlighting the insignificance of day to day life through poor UX decisions. I neglected to understand the popularity of 1 Second Everyday and instead focused on competing with other journaling and diary apps.

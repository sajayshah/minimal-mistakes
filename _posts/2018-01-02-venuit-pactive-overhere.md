title: Venuit, Pactive, OverHere
---

A brief summary of each app:

**1. Venuit**

 - Given that I am a person who has friends living all over the Bay Area
 - When I want to plan a meeting with my friends
 - Then I should I have an app that:
	 - Leverages Yelp Search so a variety of activities are suggested
	 - Knows where my friends and I typically are throughout the day so suggested activity locations minimize average travel time
	 - Allows my friends and I to vote on suggested results so group text conversation is less chaotic

**2. Pactive**

 - Given that I am an individual looking to maintain a gym routine
 - When I have trouble finding motivation to go to the gym
 - Then I should have an app that:
	 - Implements a reward system so I am incentivized to go to the gym
	 - Allows me to log my physical activity so I can track growth and progress
	 - Proposes new workouts to maintain exercise habits so I don't get bored

**3. OverHere**

 - Given that I am an individual traveling with a group
 - When the group would like to temporarily split to pursue different interests
 - Then I should have an app that:
	 - Quickly and noninvasively sets up a location tracking session so users are not concerned about privacy violations
	 - Allows me to see the general location of each individual in the group on a map so I can navigate to them
	 - Allows me to hide my location so I maintain control over being tracked

**Takeaways**
> I was essentially running with nowhere to go. I lost focus and wasted energy implementing features that were superfluous and out of scope.

I worked on these projects throughout my junior and senior year of college.  Looking back on the code written, results achieved, and lessons learned, I would say I was drifting between [unconscious and conscious incompetence.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence)

I should have completed  **Given-When-Then-So's** to obtain a **definition of  done** or a [Lean Model Canvas](https://blog.leanstack.com/why-lean-canvas-vs-business-model-canvas-af62c0f250f0) to scope out a **definition of success.**

I should have had an inflection point two weeks into each project to determine if I was building a product or having fun with new technologies. Flip-flop mentality clouds judgement.
